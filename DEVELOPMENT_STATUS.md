# Super Rock Boy - Development Status

## Project Overview
Super Rock Boy is a complete 2D HTML5 Canvas platformer game where players control an evolving rock character. The game features infinite side-scrolling in both directions, procedural content generation, animated miner enemies, and a progression system through rock evolution stages.

## Current Status: ✅ PRODUCTION READY
The game is fully functional and deployed at: https://nathannorman.github.io/super-rock-boy

## Recent Completion (Session End Status)
**Date:** December 2024  
**Status:** All major features implemented and bugs fixed

- ✅ Added player instruction overlay with controls and objectives
- ✅ Added comprehensive SEO meta tags for better web sharing
- ✅ Cleaned up duplicate/corrupted audio files
- ✅ Improved page title and descriptions

### All Major Features Completed:
- ✅ Rock character with realistic physics and rotation
- ✅ Evolution system: pebble → rock → boulder → granite → diamond
- ✅ Infinite procedural generation in both directions (platforms, spikes, miners)
- ✅ Animated miner enemies with walking legs, funny faces, and proper pickaxes
- ✅ Sound system: jump, damage, star collection, background music
- ✅ Health system with immunity frames and visual feedback
- ✅ XP/leveling system with star collection
- ✅ Infinite parallax mountain backgrounds
- ✅ Camera system with smooth following
- ✅ World level progression system
- ✅ Game over and level completion screens
- ✅ Debug panel with level controls
- ✅ Proper spike orientations (upside-down on platforms)
- ✅ Bidirectional infinite scrolling
- ✅ GitHub Pages deployment

## Game Mechanics Summary

### Controls:
- **Desktop**: Arrow Keys: Move left/right, jump
- **Mobile**: Touch controls (left/right arrows and jump button)
- Space: Restart when game over
- [/]: Debug level down/up (debug mode)
- \: Toggle debug panel

### Core Gameplay Loop:
1. Player controls a rock that evolves through 5 stages
2. Collect stars to gain XP and level up
3. Avoid miners (deal 15 damage) and spikes (deal 10 damage)
4. Upon reaching diamond evolution, advance to next world level
5. Game resets evolution but increases world difficulty
6. Infinite exploration in both directions with procedural content

### Technical Features:
- HTML5 Canvas rendering at 60 FPS
- ES6 modules architecture
- Procedural generation with cleanup (2000px radius)
- Parallax backgrounds with infinite tiling
- Physics: gravity, velocity, friction, collision detection
- Audio system with multiple sound effects
- Component-based health system

- Add power-ups or special abilities
- Add different biomes/environments
- Add particle effects for rock movement

## Code Quality Notes:
- All major bugs identified and fixed
- Sound system properly prevents overlapping audio
- Health system properly integrated with main game
- Procedural generation optimized with cleanup
- Camera system smooth and responsive
- No memory leaks identified
- Game handles edge cases (boundaries, collisions, state management)

## Testing Status:
- ✅ Manual gameplay testing completed
- ✅ All game mechanics verified working
- ✅ Performance testing passed (smooth 60 FPS)
- ✅ Cross-browser compatibility confirmed
- ✅ Mobile responsiveness confirmed
- ✅ Audio system tested across different browsers

## Next Agent Instructions:
If further development is needed, the game is in a stable state. Any new features should be added incrementally with testing. The main game logic is contained in `js/game.js` with the Health component in `js/components/Health.js`. All recent changes are committed to the GitHub repository.

**The game is complete and ready for public play!**
